Task 4 - Removing Stop Words, do Stemming and redo the task 2 (2 points)



Task 4.1 - Remove Stop Words (1 point) Describe if removing the English Stop words (most common words like ”a, the, is, are, i, you, ...”) would change the final kNN results here.
Would your result be changed heavily after removing the stop words? Why? Provide reasons.

Yes. I think the result would be changed heavily after removing the stop words. 
Since these words take majority part of pages, if they are removed, other words’ proportion would change quite different, which causes different KNN results.




Task 4.2 - Do English word stemming (1 point)
We can stem the words [”game”,”gaming”,”gamed”,”games”] to their root word ”game”. Read more about stemming here https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stemming
Would stemming change your result heavily? Why? Provide reasons and describe it.

Based on the Wikipedia, the algorithm is Suffix-stripping algorithm. 
I think the result would change heavily after implementing this stemming algorithm. Since some frequent words, like game, 
might scatter among the list. If we combine its inflected forms all together, we might get the much bigger list than each before. 
Also, we clean many fragmentary words. Therefore, the KNN results change heavily as well.
